<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>I am one of the million or more male
residents of the United Kingdom, who a year ago had no special yearning
towards military life, but who joined the
army after war was declared. At Chelsea I
found myself a unit of the 2nd London Irish
Battalion, afterwards I was drilled into shape
at the White City and training was concluded
at St. Albans, where I was drafted into the
1st Battalion. In my spare time I wrote
several articles dealing with the life of the
soldier from the stage of raw "rooky" to
that of finished fighter. These I now publish
in book form, and trust that they may interest
men who have joined the colours or who
intend to take up the profession of arms and
become members of the great brotherhood of fighters.</p>

<h1>THE AMATEUR ARMY</h1>




<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<h2 class="sc">I Enlist and am Billeted</h2>


<p>What the psychological processes were
that led to my enlisting in "Kitchener's Army" need not be
inquired into. Few men could explain
why they enlisted, and if they attempted
they might only prove that they had
done as a politician said the electorate
does, the right thing from the wrong
motive. There is a story told of an incident
that occurred in Flanders, which shows
clearly the view held in certain quarters.
The Honourable Artillery Company were
relieving some regulars in the trenches when
the following dialogue ensued between a
typical Tommy Atkins and an H.A.C. private:</p>

<p>T.A.: "Oo are you?"</p>

<p>H.A.C.: "We're the H.A.C."</p>

<p>T.A.: "Gentlemen, ain't yer?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg 14]</span>

<p>H.A.C.: "Oh well, in a way I suppose&mdash;"</p>

<p>T.A.: "'Ow many are there of yer?"</p>

<p>H.A.C.: "About eight hundred."</p>

<p>T.A.: "An' they say yer volunteered!"</p>

<p>H.A.C.: "Yes, we did."</p>

<p>T.A.: (With conviction as he gathers
together his kit). "Blimey, yer must be mad!"</p>

<p>For curiosity's sake I asked some of
my mates to give me their reasons for
enlisting. One particular friend of mine, a
good-humoured Cockney, grinned sheepishly
as he replied confidentially, "Well, matey,
I done it to get away from my old gal's
jore&mdash;now you've got it!" Another recruit,
a pale, intelligent youth, who knew Nietzsche
by heart, glanced at me coldly as he
answered, "I enlisted because I am an
Englishman." Other replies were equally
unilluminating and I desisted, remembering
that the Germans despise us because we are devoid of military enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The step once taken, however, we all
set to work to discover how we might become
soldiers with a minimum of exertion and
inconvenience to ourselves. During the process
I learned many things, among others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
that I was a unit in the most democratic
army in history; where Oxford undergraduate
and farm labourer, Cockney and peer's
son lost their identity and their caste in
a vast war machine. I learned that Tommy
Atkins, no matter from what class he is
recruited, is immortal, and that we British
are one of the most military nations in the
world. I have learned to love my new life,
obey my officers, and depend upon my rifle;
for I am Rifleman Patrick MacGill of the
Irish Rifles, where rumour has it that the
Colonel and I are the only two <i>real</i> Irishmen
in the battalion. It should be remembered
that a unit of a rifle regiment is known as
rifleman, not private; we like the term
rifleman, and feel justly indignant when a
wrong appellation plays skittles with our rank.</p>

<p>The earlier stages of our training took
place at Chelsea and the White City, where
untiring instructors strove to convince us
that we were about the most futile lot of
"rookies" that it had ever been their misfortune
to encounter. It was not until we
were unceremoniously dumped amidst the
peaceful inhabitants of a city that slumbers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
in the shadow of an ancient cathedral that I felt I was in reality a soldier.</p>

<p>Here we were to learn that there is no
novelty so great for the newly enlisted soldier
as that of being billeted, in the process of
which he finds himself left upon an unfamiliar door-step like somebody else's
washing. He is the instrument by which
the War Office disproves that "an Englishman's home is his castle." He has the
law behind him; but nothing else&mdash;save his
own capacity for making friends with his victims.</p>

<p>If the equanimity of English householders
who are about to have soldiers billeted upon
them is a test of patriotism, there may well
be some doubts about the patriotic spirit
of the English middle class in the present
crisis. The poor people welcome to their
homes soldiers who in most cases belong to
the same strata of society as themselves;
and, besides, ninepence a night as billet-fee is not to be laughed at. The upper
class can easily bear the momentary inconvenience of Tommy's company; the method
of procedure of the very rich in regard to
billeting seldom varies&mdash;a room, stripped of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page17" id="page17"></a>[pg 17]</span>
all its furniture, fitted with beds and pictures,
usually of a religious nature, is given up for
the soldiers' benefit. The lady of the house,
gifted with that familiar ease which the very
rich can assume towards the poor at a pinch&mdash;especially
a pinch like the present, when
"all petty class differences are forgotten
in the midst of the national crisis"&mdash;may
come and talk to her guests now and again,
tell them that they are fine fellows, and give
them a treat to light up the heavy hours
that follow a long day's drill in full marching
order. But the middle class, aloof and
austere in its own seclusion, limited in
means and apartment space, cannot easily
afford the time and care needed for the housing
of soldiers. State commands cannot be
gainsaid, however, and Tommy must be
housed and fed in the country which he will
shortly go out and defend in the trenches of France or Flanders.</p>

<p>The number of men assigned to a house
depends in a great measure on the discretion
of the householder and the temper of the
billeting officer. A gruff reply or a caustic
remark from the former sometimes offends;
often the officer is in a hurry, and at such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
a time disproportionate assortment is generally
the result. A billeting officer has told
me that fifty per cent. of the householders
whom he has approached show manifest
hostility to the housing of soldiers. But the
military authorities have a way of dealing
with these people. On one occasion an
officer asked a citizen, an elderly man full
of paunch and English dignity, how many
soldiers could he keep in his house. "Well, it's like this&mdash;," the man began.</p>

<p>"Have you any room to spare here?" demanded the officer.</p>

<p>"None, except on the mat," was the caustic answer.</p>

<p>"Two on the mat, then," snapped the
officer, and a pair of tittering Tommies were left at the door.</p>

<p>Matronly English dignity suffered on
another occasion when a sergeant inquired
of a middle-aged woman as to the number
of men she could billet in her house.</p>

<p>"None," she replied. "I have no way of keeping soldiers."</p>

<p>"What about that apartment there?"
asked the N.C.O. pointing to the drawing-room.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>

<p>"But they'll destroy everything in the room," stammered the woman.</p>

<p>"Clear the room then."</p>

<p>"But they'll have to pass through the hall
to get in, and there are so many valuable things on the walls&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You've got a large window in the drawing-room,"
said the officer; "remove that, and
the men will not have to pass through the hall.
I'll let you off lightly, and leave only two."</p>

<p>"But I cannot keep two."</p>

<p>"Then I'll leave four," was the reply, and four were left.</p>

<p>Sadder than this, even, was the plight
of the lady and gentleman at St. Albans
who told the officer that their four children
were just recovering from an attack of
whooping cough. The officer, being a wise
man and anxious about the welfare of those
under his care, fled precipitately. Later he
learned that there had been no whooping
cough in the house; in fact, the people who
caused him to beat such a hasty retreat were
childless. He felt annoyed and discomfited;
but about a week following his first visit
he called again at the house, this time followed by six men.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>

<p>"These fellows are just recovering from
whooping cough," he told the householder;
"they had it bad. We didn't know what
to do with them, but, seeing that you've
had whooping cough here, I feel it's the only
place where it will be safe to billet them." And he left them there.</p>

<p>But happenings like these were more
frequent at the commencement of the war
than now. Civilians, even those of the
conventional middle class, are beginning to
understand that single men in billets, to
paraphrase Kipling slightly, are remarkably like themselves.</p>

<p>With us, rations are served out daily at
our billets; our landladies do the cooking,
and mine, an adept at the culinary art, can
transform a basin of flour and a lump of
raw beef into a dish that would make an
epicurean mouth water. Even though food
is badly cooked in the billet, it has a superior
flavour, which is never given it in the boilers
controlled by the company cook. Army
stew has rather a notorious reputation, as
witness the inspired words of a regimental
poet&mdash;one of the 1st Surrey Rifles&mdash;in a pæan of praise to his colonel:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Long may the colonel with us bide,</p>
<p class="i2">His shadow ne'er grow thinner.</p>
<p>(It would, though, if he ever tried</p>
<p class="i2">Some Army stew for dinner.)"</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Billeting has gained for the soldier many
friends, and towns that have become accustomed
to his presence look sadly forward
to the day when he will leave them for the
front, where no kind landlady will be at
hand to transform raw beef and potatoes
into beef pudding or potato pie. The working
classes in particular view the future
with misgiving. The bond of sympathy
between soldier and workers is stronger than
that between soldier and any other class of
citizen. The houses and manners of the
well-to-do daunt most Tommies. "In their
houses we feel out of it somehow," they say.
"There's nothin' we can talk about with
the swells, and 'arf the time they be askin'
us about things that's no concern of theirs at all."</p>

<p>Most toilers who have no friends or relations
preparing for war have kinsmen already
in the trenches&mdash;or on the roll of honour.
And feelings stronger than those of friendship
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span>
now unite thousands of soldiers to the young
girls of the houses in which they are billeted.
For even in the modern age, that now seems
to voice the ultimate expression of man's
culture and advance in terrorism and destruction,
love and war, vital as the passion of
ancient story, go hand in hand up to the trenches and the threat of death.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>

<h2 class="sc">Rations and Sick Parade</h2>


<p>It has been said that an army moves
upon its stomach, and, as if in confirmation of this, the soldier is exhorted
in an official pamphlet "Never to start on
a march with an empty stomach." To a
hungry rifleman the question of his rations
is a matter of vital importance. For the
first few weeks our food was cooked up and
served out on the parade ground, or in the
various gutter-fringed sheds standing in the
vicinity of our headquarters. The men were
discontented with the rations, and rumour
had it that the troops stationed in a neighbouring
village rioted and hundreds had been placed under arrest.</p>

<p>Sometimes a haunch of roast beef was doled
out almost raw, and potatoes were generally
boiled into pulp; these when served up
looked like lumps of wet putty. Two potatoes,
unwashed and embossed with particles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
of gravel, were allowed to each man; all
could help themselves by sticking their
fingers into the doughy substance and lifting
out a handful, which they placed along with
the raw "roast" on the lid of their mess-tin. This constituted dinner, but often
rations were doled out so badly that several
men only got half the necessary allowance for their meals.</p>

<p>Tea was seldom sufficiently sweetened, and
the men had to pay for milk. After a time
we became accustomed to the Epsom Salts
that a kindly War Office, solicitous for our
well-being, caused to be added, and some of
us may go to our graves insisting on Epsom
Salts with tea. The feeding ground being
in many cases a great distance from the fire,
the tea was cold by the time it arrived at
the men's quarters. Those who could afford
it, took their food elsewhere: the restaurants
in the vicinity did a roaring trade, and
several new ones were opened. A petition
was written; the men signed it, and decided
to send it to the colonel; but the N.C.O.'s
stepped in and destroyed the document.
"You'll not do much good at the front," they
told us, "if you are grumbling already."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg 25]</span>

<p>A week followed the destruction of the
petition, and then appeared the following
in Battalion Orders: "From to-morrow
until further orders, rations will be issued
at the men's billets." This announcement
caused no little sensation, aroused a great
deal of comment, and created a profound feeling
of satisfaction in the battalion. Thenceforth
rations were served out at the billets,
and the householders were ordered to do the
cooking. My landlady was delighted. "Not
half feeding you; that's a game," she
said. "And you going to fight for your
country! But wait till you see the dishes
I'll make out of the rations when they come."</p>

<p>The rations came. In the early morning
a barrow piled with eatables was dragged
through our street, and the "ration fatigue"
party, full of the novelty of a new job,
yelled in chorus, "Bring out your dead, ladies; rations are 'ere!"</p>

<p>"What have you got?" asked my landlady, going to the door. "What are you
supposed to leave for the men? Nothing's
too good for them that's going to fight for their country."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg 26]</span>

<p>"Dead rats," said the ration-corporal with a grin.</p>

<p>"Don't be funny. What are my men to get?"</p>

<p>"Each man a pound of fresh meat, one and
a half pounds of bread, two taters, two ounces
of sugar, and an ounce of tea and three
ounces of cheese. And, besides this, every
feller gets a tin of jam once in four days."</p>

<p>This looks well on paper, but pot and
plate make a difference in the proposition.
Army cheese runs to rind rapidly, and a
pound of beef is often easily bitten to the
bone: sometimes, in fact, it is all bone and
gristle, and the ravages of cooking minimise
its bulk in a disheartening way. One and a
half pound of bread is more than the third
of a big loaf, but minus butter it makes a
featureless repast. Breakfast and tea without
butter and milk does not always make a dainty meal.</p>

<p>Even the distribution of rations leaves
much to be desired; the fatigue party,
well-intentioned and sympathetic though it
be, often finds itself short of provisions.
This may in many cases be due to unequal
distribution; an ounce of beef too much to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg 27]</span>
each of sixteen men leaves the seventeenth
short of meat. This may easily happen, as
the ration party has never any means of
weighing the food: it is nearly always served
out by guesswork. But sometimes the landladies
help in the distribution by bringing
out scales and weighing the provisions. One
lady in our street always weighed the men's
rations, and saw that those under her care
got the exact allowance. Never would she
take any more than her due, and never less.
But a few days ago, when weighing sugar
and tea, a blast of wind upset the scales,
and a second allowance met with a similar
fate. Sugar and tea littered the pavement,
and finally the woman supplied her soldiers
from the household stores. She now leaves
the work of distribution in the hands of the
ration party, and takes what is given to her without grumbling.</p>

<p>The soldiers' last meal is generally served
out about five o'clock in the afternoon,
sometimes earlier; and a stretch of fourteen
hours intervenes between then and breakfast.
About nine o'clock in the evening those who
cannot afford to pay for extras feel their
waist-belts slacken, and go supperless to bed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg 28]</span>
And tea is not a very substantial meal; the
rations served out for the day have decreased
in bulk, bread has wasted to microscopic proportions, and the cheese has
diminished sadly in size. A regimental song,
pent with soldierly woes, bitterly bemoans the drawbacks of Tommy's tea:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Bread and cheese for breakfast,</p>
<p class="i2">For dinner Army stew,</p>
<p>But when it comes to tea-time</p>
<p class="i2">There's dough and rind for you,</p>
<p class="i6">So you and me</p>
<p class="i6">Won't wait for tea&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">We're jolly big fools if we do."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>But those who do not live in billets, and
whose worldly wealth fails to exceed a shilling
a day, must be content with Army rations,
with the tea tasting of coom, and seldom
sweetened, with the pebble-studded putty
potato coated in clay, with the cheese that
runs to rind at last parade, and, above all,
with the knowledge that they are merely
inconvenienced at home so that they may endure the better abroad.</p>

<p>There is another school of theorists that
states that an army moves, not upon its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg 29]</span>
stomach, but upon its feet, the care of which
is of vital importance. This, too, finds confirmation
in the official pamphlet, which
tells the soldier to "Remember that a dirty
foot is an unsound foot. See that feet are
washed if no other part of the body is," etc.</p>

<p>My right foot had troubled me for days;
a pain settled in the arch of the instep, and
caused me intense agony when resuming
the march after a short halt; at night I
would suddenly awake from sleep to experience
the sensation of being stabbed by innumerable pins in ankle and toes. Marching
in future, I felt, would be a monstrous futility,
and I decided that my case was one for the medical officer.</p>

<p>Sick parade is not restricted by any dress
order; the sore-footed may wear slippers;
the sore-headed, Balaclava helmets; puttees
can be discarded; mufflers and comforters may be used. "The sick rabble" is
the name given by the men to the
crowd that waits outside the door of the
M.O.'s room at eight in the morning. And
every morning brings its quota of ailing
soldiers; some seriously ill, some slightly,
and a few (as may be expected out of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg 30]</span>
thousand men of all sorts and conditions)
who have imaginary or feigned diseases that
will so often save "slackers" from a hard
day's marching. The aim and ambition of
these latter seem to be to do as little hard
work as possible; some of them attend
sick parade on an average once a week,
and generally obtain exemption from a day's
work. To obtain this they resort to several
ruses; headaches and rheumatic pains are
difficult to detect, and the doctor must depend
on the private's word; a quick pulse and
heightened temperature is engendered by a
brisk run, and this is often a means towards
a favourable medical verdict&mdash;that is, when
"favourable" means a suspension of duties.</p>

<p>At a quarter to eight I stood with ten
others in front of the M.O.'s door, on which
a white card with the blue-lettered "No
Smoking" stood out in bold relief. The
morning was bitterly cold, and a sharp,
penetrating wind splashed with rain swept
round our ears, and chilled our hands and
faces. One of the waiting queue had a sharp
cough and spat blood; all this was due,
he told us, to a day's divisional field exercise,
when he had to lie for hours on the wet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg 31]</span>
ground firing "blanks" at a "dummy"
enemy. Another sick soldier, a youth of
nineteen, straight as a lance and lithe as a
poplar, suffered from ulcer in the throat.
"I had the same thing before," he remarked
in a thin, hoarse voice, "but I got over it
somehow. This time it'll maybe the hospital. I don't know."</p>

<p>An orderly corporal filled in admission
forms and handed them to us; each form
containing the sick man's regimental number,
name, religion, age, and length of military
service, in addition to several other minor
details having no reference at all to the
matter in hand. These forms were again
handed over to another orderly corporal,
who stood smoking a cigarette under the
blue-lettered notice pinned to the door.</p>

<p>The boy with the sore throat was sitting
in a chair in the room when I entered, the
doctor bending over him. "Would you like
a holiday?" the M.O. asked in a kindly voice.</p>

<p>"Where to, sir?"</p>

<p>"A couple of days in hospital would leave
you all right, my man," the M.O. continued, "and it would be a splendid rest."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg 32]</span>

<p>"I don't want a rest," answered the youth.
"Maybe I'll be better in the morning, sir."</p>

<p>The doctor thought for a moment, then:</p>

<p>"All right, report to-morrow again," he
said. "You're a brave boy. Some, who are
not the least ill, whine till one is sick&mdash;what's the matter with you?"</p>

<p>"Sore foot, sir," I said, seeing the M.O.'s eyes fixed on me.</p>

<p>"Off with your boot, then."</p>

<p>I took off my boot, placed my foot on a chair, and had it inspected.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir. It pains me when marching, and sometimes&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Have you ever heard that Napoleon said an army marches on its stomach?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, when the feet of the army is all right," I answered.</p>

<p>"Quite true," he replied. "No doubt
you've sprained one of yours; just wash it
well in warm water, rub it well, and have a
day or two resting. That will leave you all right. Your boots are good?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"They don't pinch or&mdash;what's wrong with
you?" He was speaking to the next man.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg 33]</span>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Don't know? You don't know why
you're here. What brought you here?"</p>

<p>"Rheumatic pains, I think, sir," was the
answer. "Last night I 'ad an orful night.
Couldn't sleep. I think it was the wet as
done it. Lyin' out on the grass last field day&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How many times have you been here before?"</p>

<p>"Well, sir, the last time was when&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How many times?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, sir."</p>

<p>"Was it rheumatic pains last time?"</p>

<p>"No sir, it was jaw-ache&mdash;toothache, I mean."</p>

<p>"I'll put you on light duties for the day,"
said the M.O. And the rheumatic one and I went out together.</p>

<p>"That's wot they do to a man that's sick,"
said the rheumatic one when we got outside.
"Me that couldn't sleep last night, and now
it's light duties. I know what light duties
are. You are to go into the orderly room
and wash all the dishes: then you go and
run messages, then you 'old the orficer's
horse and then maybe when you're worryin'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg 34]</span>
your own bit of grub they come and bundle
you out to sweep up the orficers' mess, or run
an errand for the 'ead cook and bottle-washer. Light duties ain't arf a job. I'm
blowed if marchin' in full kit ain't ten times
better, and I'm going to grease to the battalion parade."</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later I met him leaving
his billet, his haversack on the wrong side,
his cartridge pouches open, the bolt of his
gun unfastened; his whole general appearance
was a discredit to his battalion and a
disgrace to the Army. I helped to make
him presentable as he bellowed his woes into
my ear. "No bloomin' grub this mornin',"
he said. "Left my breakfast till I'd come
back, and 'aven't no time for it now. Anyway
I'm going out on the march; no light
duties for me. I know what they are."
He was still protesting against the hardships
of things as he swung out of sight round the
corner of the street. Afterwards I heard that
he got three days C.B. for disobeying the orders of the M.O.</p>

<p>Save for minor ailments and accident, my
battalion is practically immune from sickness; colds come and go as a matter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg 35]</span>
course, sprains and cuts claim momentary
attention, but otherwise the health of the
battalion is perfect. "We're too healthy
to be out of the trenches," a company
humorist has remarked, and the company and battalion agrees with him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h2 class="sc">Pickets and Special Leave</h2>


<p>One of the first things we had to learn
was that our ancient cathedral town has its bounds and limits for the
legions of the lads in khaki. Beyond a
certain line, the two-mile boundary, we dare
not venture alone without written permission,
and we can only pass the limit in a
body when led by a commissioned officer.</p>

<p>The whole world, with the exception of
the space enclosed by this narrow circle, is
closed to the footsteps of Tommy; he cannot
now visit his sweetheart, his sweetheart
must come and visit him. The housemaid
from Hammersmith and the typist from
Tottenham have to come to their beaux in
billets, and as most of the men in our town
are single, and nearly all have sweethearts,
it is estimated that five or six thousand
maidens blush to hear the old, old story
within the two-mile limit every week-end.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg 37]</span>

<p>Once only every month is a soldier allowed
week-end leave, and then he has permission
to be absent from his billet between the
hours of 3 p.m. on Saturday and 10 p.m.
on Sunday. His pass states that during this
time he is not liable to be arrested for desertion.
Some men use one pass for quite a
long period, and alter the dates to suit every occasion.</p>

<p>One Sunday, when returning from week-end
leave, I travelled from London by train.
My compartment was crowded with men of
my division, and only one-half of these had
true passes; one, who was an adept calligraphist, wrote his own pass, and made a
counterfeit signature of the superior who
should have signed the form of leave.
Another had altered the dates of an early
pass so cleverly that it was difficult to
detect the erasure, and a number of men
had no passes whatsoever. These boasted
of having travelled to London every week-end,
and they had never been caught napping.</p>

<p>Passes were generally inspected at the
station preceding the one to which we were
bound. My travelling companions were well
aware of this, and made preparations to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg 38]</span>
combat the difficulty in front; two crawled
under the seats, and two more went up
on the racks, where they lay quiet as mice,
stretched out at full length and covered
over with several khaki overcoats. One
man, a brisk Cockney, who would not deign
to roost or crawl, took up his position as
far away as possible from the platform window.</p>

<p>"Grease the paper along as quick as
you know 'ow and keep the picket jorin'
till I'm safe," he remarked as the train
stopped and a figure in khaki fumbled with the door handle.</p>

<p>"Would you mind me lookin' at passes,
mateys?" demanded the picket, entering
the compartment. The man by the door
produced his pass, the one he had written
and signed himself; and when it passed
inspection he slyly slipped it behind the
back of the man next him, and in the space
of three seconds the brisk Cockney had the
forged permit of leave to show to the inspector.
The men under the seat and on the racks were not detected.</p>

<p>Every station in our town and its vicinity
has a cordon of pickets, the Sunday farewell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg 39]</span>
kisses of sweethearts are never witnessed
by the platform porter, as the lovers in
khaki are never allowed to see their loves
off by train, and week-end adieux always
take place at the station entrance. Some
time ago the pickets allowed the men to
see their sweethearts off, but as many youths
abused the privilege and took train to London
when they got on the platform, these
kind actions have now become merely a pleasing memory.</p>

<p>Pickets seem to crop up everywhere;
on one bus ride to London, a journey of
twenty miles, I have been asked to show
my pass three times, and on a return journey by train I have had to produce the
written permit on five occasions. But some
units of our divisions soar above these petty
inconveniences, as do two brothers who
motor home every Sunday when church parade comes to an end.</p>

<p>When these two leave church after divine
service, a car waits them at the nearest
street corner, and they slip into it, don
trilby hats and civilian overcoats, and sweep
outside the restricted area at a haste that
causes the slow-witted country policeman
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg 40]</span>
to puzzle over the speed of the car and
forget its number while groping for his pocket-book.</p>

<p>It has always been a pleasure to me to
follow for hours the winding country roads
looking out for fresh scenes and new adventures.
The life of the roadside dwellers,
the folk who live in little stone houses and
show two flower-pots and a birdcage in
their windows, has a strange fascination
for me. When I took up my abode here
and got my first free Sunday afternoon,
I shook military discipline aside for a moment and set out on one of my rambles.</p>

<p>There comes a moment on a journey when
something sweet, something irresistible and
charming as wine raised to thirsty lips,
wells up in the traveller's being. I have
never striven to analyse this feeling or
study the moment when it comes, and
that feeling has been often mine. Now I
know the moment it floods the soul of
the traveller. It is at the end of the second
mile, when the limbs warm to their work
and the lungs fill with the fresh country air. At such a moment, when a man
naturally forgets restraint to which he has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg 41]</span>
only been accustomed for a short while,
I met the picket for the first time. He
told me to turn&mdash;and I went back. But
it was not in my heart to like that picket,
and I shall never like him while he stands
there, sentry of the two-mile limit; an
ogre denying me entrance into the wide world that lies beyond.</p>

<p>There is one thing, however, before which
the picket is impotent&mdash;a pass. It is like
a free pardon to a convict; it opens to him
the whole world&mdash;that is for the period
it covers. The two most difficult things
in military life are to obtain permit of absence
from billets, and the struggle against
the natural impulse to overstay the limit
of leave. There are times when soldiers
experience an intense longing to see their
own homes, firesides, and friends, and in
moments like these it takes a stiff fight
to overcome the desire to go away, if only
for a little while, to their native haunts.
Only once in five weeks may a man obtain
a week-end pass&mdash;if he is lucky. To the
soldier, luck is merely another word for skill.</p>

<p>With us, the rifleman who scores six successive "bulls" at six hundred yards on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg 42]</span>
the open range has been lucky; if he speaks
nicely to the quartermaster and obtains
the best pair of boots in the stores, he has
been lucky; if by mistake he is given double
rations by the fatigue party he is lucky;
but if the same man, sweating over his
rifle in a carnival of "wash-outs," or, weary
of blistered feet and empty stomach, asks
for sympathy because his rifle was sighted
too low or because he lost his dinner while
waiting on boot-parade, we explain that
his woes are due to a caper of chance&mdash;that he has been unlucky. To obtain a
pass at any time a man must be lucky;
obtaining one when he desires it most is a
thing heard of now and again, and getting
a pass and not being able to use it is of
common occurrence. Now, when I applied
for special leave I was more than a little lucky.</p>

<p>It was necessary that I should attend
to business in London, and I set about
making application for a permit of leave.
I intended to apply for a pass dating from
6 p.m. of a Friday evening to 10 p.m. of the
following Sunday. On Wednesday morning
I spoke to a corporal of my company.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg 43]</span>

<p>"If you want leave, see the platoon
sergeant," he told me. The platoon sergeant, who was in a bad temper, spoke
harshly when I approached him. "No business of mine!" he said; "the company
clerk will look into the matter."</p>

<p>But I had no success with the company
clerk; the leave which I desired was a
special one, and that did not come under
his jurisdiction. "The orderly sergeant
knows more about this business than I do. Go to him about it," he said.</p>

<p>By Wednesday evening I spoke to the
orderly sergeant, who looked puzzled for
a moment. "Come with me to the lieutenant," he said. "He'll know more about
this matter than I do, and he'll see into
it. But it will be difficult to get special
leave, you know; they don't like to give it."</p>

<p>"Why?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Why?" he repeated; "what the devil
does it matter to you? You're paid here
to do what you're told, not to ask questions."</p>

<p>The lieutenant was courteous and civil.
"I can't do anything in the matter," he
said. "The orderly sergeant will take you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg 44]</span>
to the company officer, Captain &mdash;&mdash;, and he'll maybe do something for you."</p>

<p>"If you're lucky," said the sergeant in
a low whisper. About eight o'clock in the
evening I paraded in the long, dimly-lighted
passage that leads to our company orderly-room,
and there I had to wait two hours
while the captain was conducting affairs
of some kind or another inside. When the door was opened I was ordered inside.</p>

<p>"Quick march! Left turn! Halt!"
ordered the sergeant as I crossed the threshold,
and presently I found myself face
to face with our company commander, who
was sitting by a desk with a pile of papers before him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he asked, fixing a pair
of stern eyes on me, and I explained my
business with all possible despatch.</p>

<p>"Of course you understand that everything
is now subservient to your military
duties; they take premier place in your
new life," said the officer. "But I'll see
what I can do. By myself I am of little
help. However, you can write out a pass
telling the length of time you require off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg 45]</span>
duty, and I'll lay it before the proper authorities."</p>

<p>I wrote out the "special pass," which ran as follows:</p>

<p>"Rifleman &mdash;&mdash; has permission to be
absent from his quarters from 6 p.m. (date)
to 10 p.m. (date), for the purpose of proceeding to London."</p>

<p>I came in from a long march on Thursday
evening to find the pass signed, stamped,
and ready. On the following night I could
go to London, and I spent the evening
'phoning, wiring, and writing to town, arranging
matters for the day ahead. Also,
I asked some friends to have dinner with
me at seven o'clock on Friday night.</p>

<p>Next day we had divisional exercise,
which is usually a lengthy affair. In the
morning I approached the officer and asked
if I might be allowed off parade, seeing
I had to set out for London at six o'clock in the evening.</p>

<p>"Oh! we shall be back early," I was
told, "back about three or thereabouts."</p>

<p>The day was very interesting; the whole
division, thousands of men, numberless
horses, a regiment of artillery, and all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg 46]</span>
baggage and munition for military use took
up position in battle formation. In front
lay an imaginary army, and we had to
cross a river to come into contact with it.
Engineers, under cover of the artillery,
built pontoon bridges for our crossing; on
the whole an intensely interesting and novel
experience. So interesting indeed that I
lost all count of time, and only came to
consciousness of the clock and remembrance
of friends making ready for dinner when
some one remarked that the hour of four
had passed, and that we were still five miles from home.</p>

<p>I got to my billet at six; there I flung
off my pack, threw down my rifle, and in
frenzied haste consulted a railway timetable. A slow train was due to leave our
town at five minutes to seven. I arranged
my papers, made a brief review of matters
which would come before me later, and
with muddy boots and heavy heart I arrived
at the station at seven minutes to seven
and took the slow train for London.</p>

<p>When I told the story of my adventures
at dinner a soldier friend remarked: "You've
been more than a little lucky in getting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg 47]</span>
away at all. I was very unlucky when I applied&mdash;"</p>

<p>But his story was a long one, and I have forgotten it.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg 48]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h2 class="sc">Officers and Rifles</h2>


<p>As I have said, I have learned among
other things to obey my officers and depend upon my rifle. At first the
junior officers appeared to me only as immaculate
young men in tailor-made tunics
and well-creased trousers, wearing swords
and wrist-watches, and full of a healthy
belief in their own importance. My mates
are apt to consider them as being somewhat
vain, and no Tommy dares fail to salute
the young commissioned officers when he
meets them out with their young ladies on
the public streets. For myself, I have a
great respect for them and their work;
day and night they are at their toil; when
parade comes to an end, and the battalion
is dismissed for the day, the officers, who
have done ten or twelve hours' of field exercise,
turn to their desks and company accounts, and time and again the Last Post
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg 49]</span>
sees them busy over ledgers, pamphlets, and plans.</p>

<p>Accurate and precise in every detail, they
know the outs and ins of platoon and company
drill, and can handle scores and hundreds
of men with the ease and despatch of
artists born to their work. Where have
these officers, fresh youngsters with budding
moustaches and white, delicate hands, learned
all about frontage, file, flank, and formation,
alignment, echelon, incline, and interval?
Words of direction and command come so
readily from their lips that I was almost
tempted to believe that they had learned
as easily as they taught, that their skill in
giving orders could only be equalled by the
ease with which I supposed they had mastered the details of their work. Later I
came to know of the difficulty that confronts
the young men, raw from the Officers'
Training Corps, when they take up their
preliminary duties as commanders of trained
soldiers. No "rooky" fresh to the ranks
is the butt of so many jokes and such biting
sarcasm as the young officer is subjected to
when he takes his place as a leader of men.</p>

<p>Soon after my arrival in our town a score
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg 50]</span>
of young lieutenants came to our parade
ground, accompanied by two commanders,
a keen-eyed adjutant, brisk as a bell, and
a white-haired colonel with very thin legs,
and putties which seemed to have been
glued on to his shins. The young gentlemen
were destined for various regiments, and
most of them were fresh and spotless in their
new uniforms. Some wore Glengarry bonnets,
kilts, and sporrans, some the black
ribbons of Wales; one, whose hat-badge
proclaimed the Dublin Fusilier, was conspicuous
by the eyeglass he wore, and others
were still arrayed in civilian garb, the uniform
of city and office life. Several units of my
battalion were taken off to drill in company
with the strange officers. I was one of the chosen.</p>

<p>The young men took us in hand, acting
in turn as corporals, platoon sergeants, and
company commanders. The gentleman with
the eyeglass had charge of my platoon, and
from the start he cast surreptitious glances
at a little red brochure which he held in his
hand, and mumbled words as if trying to commit something to memory.</p>

<p>"Get to your places," the adjutant yelled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page51" id="page51"></a>[pg 51]</span>
to the officers. "Hurry up! Don't stand
there gaping as if you're going to snap at
flies. We've got to do some work. There's
no hay for those who don't work. Come on,
Weary, and drill your men; you with the
eyeglass, I mean! I want you to put the
company through some close column movements."</p>

<p>The man with the eyeglass took up his
position, and issued some order, but his
voice was so low that the men nearest him could not hear the command.</p>

<p>"Shout!" yelled the adjutant. "Don't
mumble like a flapper who has just got her
first kiss. It's not allowed on parade."</p>

<p>The order was repeated, and the voice raised a little.</p>

<p>"Louder, louder!" yelled the adjutant.
Then with fine irony: "These men are
very interested in what you've got to tell them.... I don't think."</p>

<p>Eyeglass essayed another attempt, but
stopped in the midst of his words, frozen
into mute helplessness by the look of the adjutant.</p>

<p>"For heaven's sake, try and speak up,"
the adjutant said. "If you don't talk like
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg 52]</span>
a man, these fellows won't salute you when
they meet you in the street with your young
lady. On second thoughts, you had better
go back and take up the job of platoon
sergeant. Come on, Glengarry, and try and trumpet an order."</p>

<p>Glengarry, so-called from his bonnet, a
sturdy youth with sloping shoulders, took up his post nervously.</p>

<p>"A close column forming column of fours,"
he cried in a shrill treble, quoting the cautionary
part of his command. "Advance
in fours from the right; form fours&mdash;right!"</p>

<p>"Form fours&mdash;where?" roared the adjutant.</p>

<p>"Left," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Left, your grandmother! You were
right at first. Did you not know that you
were right?... Where's Eyeglass, the
platoon sergeant, now? Who's pinched him?"</p>

<p>This unfortunate officer had dropped his
eyeglass, and was now groping for it on the
muddy ground, one of my mates helping him in the search.</p>

<p>Other officers took up the job of company
commander in turn, and all suffered. One,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg 53]</span>
who was a dapper little fellow, speedily
earned the nickname of "Tailor's Dummy;"
another, when giving a platoon the wrong
direction in dressing, was told to be careful,
and not shove the regiment over. A third,
a Welshman, with the black ribbons, got
angry with a section for some slight mistake
made by two of its number, and was told
to be careful and not annoy the men. He had only got them on appro'.</p>

<p>Spick and span in their new uniforms,
they came to drill daily on our parade
ground. Slowly the change took place.
They were "rookies" no longer, and the
adjutant's sarcasm was a thing of the past.
Commands were pronounced distinctly and
firmly; the officers were trained men, ready
to lead a company of soldiers anywhere and to do anything.</p>

<p>No man who has trained with the new
armies can be lacking in respect for the
indefatigable N.C.O., upon whom the brunt
of the work has fallen. With picturesque
scorn and sarcasm he has formed huge
armies out of the rawest of raw material,
and all in a space of less than half a year.
His methods are sometimes strange and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg 54]</span>
temper short; yet he achieves his end in
the shortest time possible. He is for ever
correcting the same mistakes and rebuking
the same stupidity, and the wonder is, not
that he loses his temper, but that he should
ever be able to preserve it. He understands
men, and approaches them in an idiom that
is likely to produce the best results.</p>

<p>"Every man of you has friends of some
sort," said the musketry instructor, as we
formed up in front of him on the parade
ground, gripping with nervous eagerness the
rifles which had just been served out from
the quartermaster's stores. We were recruits, raw "rookies," green to the grind,
and chafing under discipline. "And some
sort of friends it would be as well as if you
never met them," the instructor continued.
"They'd play you false the minute they'd
get your back turned. But you've a friend
now that will always stand by you and
play you fair. Just give him a chance,
and he'll maybe see you out of many a tight
corner. Now, who is this friend I'm talking
about?" he asked, turning to a youth who
was leaning on his rifle. "Come, Weary, and tell me."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg 55]</span>

<p>"The rifle," was the answer.</p>

<p>"The crutch?"</p>

<p>"No, the rifle."</p>

<p>"I see that, boy, I see that! But, damn
it, don't make a crutch of it. You're a
soldier now, my man, and not a crippled one yet."</p>

<p>Thus was the rifle introduced to us. We
had long waited for its coming, and dreamt
of cross-guns, the insignia of a crack shot's
proficiency, while we waited. And with the
rifle came romance, and the element of responsibility.
We were henceforward fighting
men, numbered units, it was true, with
numbered weapons, but for all that, fighters&mdash;men
trained to the trade and licensed to the profession.</p>

<p>Our new friend was rather a troublesome
individual to begin with. In rising to the
slope he had the trick of breaking free and
falling on the muddy barrack square. A
muddy rifle gets rusty, and brings its owner
into trouble, and a severe penalty is considered meet for the man who comes on
parade with a rusty rifle. Bringing the
friend from the slope to the order was a
difficult process for us recruits at the start
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg 56]</span>
the back-sight tore at the fingers, and bleeding
hands often testified to the unnatural
instinct of the rebellious weapon. But the
unkindest kick of all was given when the
slack novice fired the first shot, and the heel
of the butt slipped upwards and struck the
jaw. Then was learnt the first real lesson.
The rifle kicks with the heel and aims for
the jaw. Control your friend, humour him;
keep him well in hand and beware his fling.</p>

<p>I was unlucky in my first rifle practice
on the miniature range, and out of my first
five shots I did not hit the target once. The
instructor lay by my side on the waterproof
ground-sheet (the day was a wet one,
and the range was muddy) and lectured me
between misses on the peculiarities of my
weapon and the cultivation of a steady eye.</p>

<p>"Keep the beggar under control," he
said. "You've got to coax him, and not
use force. Pull the trigger easily, as though
you loved it, and hold the butt affectionate-like
against the shoulder. It's an easy
matter to shoot as you're shooting now.
There's shooting and shooting, and you've got
to shoot straight. If you don't you're no
dashed good! Give me the rifle, you're
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg 57]</span>
not aiming at the bull, man, you're aiming
at the locality where the bull is grazing."</p>

<p>He took my rifle, slid a cartridge into the
breech, and coaxed the trigger lovingly towards
him. Three times he fired, then we
went together to look at the target. Not a
bullet fired by him had struck it. The
instructor glared down the barrel of the
gun, made some nasty remarks about deflection,
and went back to yell at an orderly corporal.</p>

<p>"What the dickens did you take this
here for?" he cried. "It's a blooming
wash-out,<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> and was never any good. Old
as an unpaid bill and worn bell-mouth it is, and nobody can fire with it."</p>

<p>On a new rifle being obtained I passed
the preliminary test, and a rather repentant
instructor remarked that it might be possible to make a soldier of me some day.</p>

<p>Since then my fellow-soldiers and I have
had almost unlimited rifle practice, on miniature
and open ranges, at bull and disappearing
targets, in field firing at distances from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg 58]</span>
100 to 600 yards. On a field exceeding
600 yards it is almost impossible to hit a point
the size of an ordinary bull; fire then must
be directed towards a position. Field or
volley firing is very interesting. Once my
company took train to Dunstable and advanced
on an imaginary enemy that occupied
the wastes of the Chiltern Hills. Practice
commenced by firing at little squares of
iron standing upright in a row about 200
yards off in front of our line. These represented
heads and shoulders of men rising
over the trenches to take aim at us as we
advanced. In extended order we came to
our position, 200 yards distant from the front
trenches. At the sound of the officer's
whistle, we sank to the ground, facing our
front, fixed our sights, and loaded. A second
whistle was blown; we fired "three rounds
rapid" at the foe. The aiming was very
accurate; little spurts of earth danced up
and around the targets, and every iron
disc fell. The "searching ground," the
locality struck by bullets, scarcely measured
a dozen paces from front to rear, thus
showing that there was very little erratic firing.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg 59]</span>

<p>"That's some shooting!" my Jersey friend
remarked. "If the discs were Germans!"</p>

<p>"They might shoot back," someone said,
"and then we mightn't take as cool an aim."</p>

<p>We are trained to the rifle; it is always
with us, on parade, on march, on bivouac,
and recently, when going through a dental
examination, we carried our weapons of war
into the medical officer's room. As befits
units of a rifle regiment, we have got accustomed
to our gun, and now, as fully trained
men, we have established the necessary unity
between hand and eye, and can load and
unload our weapon with butt-plate stiff to
shoulder and eye steady on target while the
operation is in progress. In fact, our rifle
comes to hand as easy as a walking-stick.
We shall be sorry to lose it when the war is
over, and no doubt we shall feel lonely without it.</p>

<blockquote class="footnote"><a id="footnote1" name="footnote1"></a><b>Footnote 1: </b><a href="#footnotetag1">(return) </a><p>"Wash-out" is a term used by the men when

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h2 class="sc">The Coffee-Shop and Wankin</h2>


<p>What the pump is to the villager,
so the coffee-shop is to the soldier of the New Army. Here the men
crowd nightly and live over again the incidents
of the day. Our particular coffee-shop
is situated in our corner of the town;
our men patronise it; there are three assistants,
plump, merry girls, and three of our
men have fallen in love with them; in short,
it is our very own restaurant, opened when
we came here, and adapted to our needs;
the waitresses wear our hat-badges, sing our
songs, and make us welcome when we cross
the door to take up our usual chairs and
yarn over the cosy tables. The Jersey
youth with the blue eyes, the Oxford man,
who speaks of things that humble waitresses
do not understand, the company drummer,
the platoon sergeants, and the Cockney
who vows that water is spoilt in making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg 61]</span>
every cup of coffee he drinks, all come here, and all love the place.</p>

<p>I have come to like the place and do
most of my writing there, catching snatches
of conversation and reminiscence as they float across to me.</p>

<p>"I wasn't meanin' to 'urt ole Ginger
Nobby nohow, but the muck I throwed took
'im dead on the jor. 'Wot's yer gime?'
'e 'ollers at me. 'Wot's my gime?' I says
back to 'im. 'Nuffin', if ye want ter know!'
I says. 'I was just shyin' at squidges.'"</p>

<p>Thus spoke the bright-eyed Cockney at
the table next me, gazing regretfully at his
empty coffee-cup and cutting away a fringe
of rag-nails from his finger with a clasp-knife.
The time was eight o'clock of the
evening, and the youth was recounting an
adventure which he had had in the morning
when throwing mud at sparrows on the
parade ground. A lump of clay had struck
a red-haired non-commissioned officer on the
jaw, and the officer became angry. The
above was the Cockney version of the story.
One of my friends, an army unit with the
Oxford drawl, was voluble on another subject.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg 62]</span>

<p>"Russian writers have had a great effect on
our literature," he said, deep in a favourite
topic. "They have stripped bare the soul
of man with a realism that shrivels up our
civilisation and proves&mdash;Two coffees, please."</p>

<p>A tall, well-set waitress, with several
rings on her fingers, took the order as gravely
as if she were performing some religious
function; then she turned to the Cockney.</p>

<p>"Cup of cawfee, birdie!" he cried, leaning
over the table and trying to grip her hand.
"Not like the last, mind; it was good
water spoilt. I'll never come in 'ere again."</p>

<p>"So you say!" said the girl, moving
out of his way and laughing loudly.</p>

<p>"Strike me balmy if I do!"</p>

<p>"Where'll yer go then?"</p>

<p>"Round the corner, of course," was the
answer. "There's another bird there&mdash;and
cawfee! It's some stuff too, not like 'ere."</p>

<p>"All right; don't come in again if yer don't want ter."</p>

<p>The Cockney got his second cup of coffee
and pronounced it inferior to the first;
then looked at an evening paper which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg 63]</span>
Oxford handed to him, and studied a photograph
of a battleship on the front page.</p>

<p>"Can't stand these 'ere papers," he said,
after a moment, as he got to his feet and
lit a cigarette. "Nuffink but war in them
always; I'm sick readin' about war! I
saw your bit in one a couple of nights ago," he said, turning to me.</p>

<p>"What did you think of it?" I asked,
anxious to hear his opinion on an article
dealing with the life of his own regiment.</p>

<p>"Nuffink much," he answered, honestly
and frankly. "Everything you say is about
things we all know; who wants to 'ear
about them? D'ye get paid for writin' that?"</p>

<p>One of his mates, a youth named Bill,
who came in at that moment, overheard the remark.</p>

<p>"Paid! Of course 'e gets paid," said
the newcomer. "Bet you he gets 'arf a
crown for every time 'e writes for the paper."</p>

<p>All sorts and conditions of soldiers drift
into the place and discuss various matters
over coffee and mince pies; they are men
of all classes, who had been as far apart
as the poles in civil life, and are now knit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg 64]</span>
together in the common brotherhood of war.
Caste and estate seem to have been forgotten;
all are engaged in a common business,
full of similar risks, and rewarded by a similar wage.</p>

<p>In one corner of the room a game of cards
was in progress, some soldiers were reading,
and a few writing letters. Now and again
a song was heard, and a score of voices
joined in the chorus. The scene was one of
indescribable gaiety; the temperament of
the assembly was like a hearty laugh, infectious
and healthy. Now and then a discussion took place, and towards the close
of the evening hot words were exchanged
between Bill and his friend, the bright-eyed Cockney.</p>

<p>"I'll give old Ginger Nobby what for one day!" said the latter.</p>

<p>"Will you? I don't think!"</p>

<p>"Bet yer a bob I will!"</p>

<p>"You'd lose it."</p>

<p>"Would I?"</p>

<p>"Straight you would!"</p>

<p>"Strike me pink if I would!"</p>

<p>"You know nothin' of what you're sayin'."</p>

<p>"Don't I?"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg 65]</span>

<p>"Git!"</p>

<p>"Shut!"</p>

<p>In the coffee-shop Wankin is invariably
the centre of an interested group. As the
company scapegrace and black sheep of the
battalion he occupies in his mates' eyes
a position of considerable importance. His
repartees are famous, and none knows better
than he how to score off an unpopular officer
or N.C.O. He has the distinction also of
having spent more days in the guard-room
than any other man in the battalion.</p>

<p>On the occasion when identity discs were
being served out to the men and a momentary
stir pervaded the battalion, it was Wankin
who first became involved in trouble.</p>

<p>He employed the disc string to fasten the
water-bottle of the man on his left to the
haversack of the man on his right, and the
colour-sergeant, livid with rage, vowed to
chasten him by confining him eternally to
barracks. But the undaunted company
scapegrace was not to be beaten. Fastening
the identity disc on his left eye he fixed a stern look on the sergeant.</p>

<p>"My deah fellah," he drawled out, imitating
the voice of the company lieutenant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg 66]</span>
who wears an eyeglass, "your remarks are
uncalled for, really. By Jove! one would
think that a scrap of string was a gold
bracelet or a diamond necklace. I could
buy the disc and the string for a bloomin' 'apenny."</p>

<p>"You'll pay dearly for it this time," said
the colour with fine irony. "Three days
C.B.<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> your muckin' about'll cost you."
And before Wankin could reply the sergeant
was reporting the matter to the captain.</p>

<p>Wankin is eternally in trouble, although
his agility in dodging pickets and his skill
in making a week's C.B. a veritable holiday
are the talk of the regiment. All the
officers know him, and many of them who
have been victims of his smart repartee
fear him more than they care to acknowledge.
The subaltern with the eyeglass is a bad
route-marcher, and Wankin once remarked
in an audible whisper that the officer had
learned his company drill with a drove of
haltered pack-horses, and the officer bears
the name of "Pack-horse" ever since.</p>

<p>On another occasion the major suffered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg 67]</span>
when a battalion kit inspection took place
early one December morning. Wankin had
sold his spare pair of boots, the pair that
is always kept on top of the kit-bag; but
when the major inspected Wankin's kit the
boots were there, newly polished and freed
from the most microscopic speck of dust.
Someone tittered during the inspection, then
another, and the major smelt a rat. He
lifted Wankin's kit-bag in his hand and
found Wankin's feet tucked under it&mdash;Wankin's
feet in stockinged soles. The major
was justly indignant. "One step to the
front, left turn," he roared. "March in
front of every rank in the battalion and see what you think of it!"</p>

<p>With stockinged feet, cold, but still wearing
an inscrutable smile of impudence, Wankin
paraded in front of a thousand grinning
faces and in due course got back to his kit and beside the sarcastic major.</p>

<p>"What do you think of it?" asked the latter.</p>

<p>"I don't think much of it, sir," Wankin
replied. "It's the dirtiest regiment I ever inspected."</p>

<p>Wankin was sometimes unlucky; fortune
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg 68]</span>
refused to favour him when he took up the
work of picket on the road between St.
Albans and London. No unit of his regiment
is supposed to go more than two miles
beyond St. Albans without a written permit,
and guards are placed at different points of
the two-mile radius to intercept the regimental
rakes whose feet are inclined to roving.
Wankin learned that the London road was
not to be guarded on a certain Sunday.
The regiment was to parade for a long route-march,
and all units were to be in attendance. Wankin pondered over things for a
moment, girt on his belt and sword and took
up his position on the London road within
a hundred yards of a wayside public-house.
At this tavern a traveller from St. Albans
may obtain a drink on a Sabbath day.</p>

<p>Soldiers, like most mortals, are sometimes
dry and like to drink; Wankin was often
dry and Wankin had seldom much money
to spend. The first soldier who came out
from the town wanted to get to the tavern.</p>

<p>"Can't pass here!" the mock-picket told him.</p>

<p>"But I'm dry and I've a cold that catches me awful in the throat."</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg 69]</span>

<p>"Them colds are dangerous," Wankin
remarked in a contemplative voice, tinged
with compassion. "Used to have them bad
myself an' I feel one coming on. I think
gin, same as they have in the trenches, is
the stuff to put a cold away. But I'm on the rocks."</p>

<p>"If you'll let me through I'll stand on my hands."</p>

<p>"It's risky," said Wankin, then in a brave
burst of bravado he said, "Damn it all!
I'll let you go by. It's hard to stew dry
so near the bar!" An hour later the young
man set off towards home, and on his way
he met two of his comrades-in-arms on the road.</p>

<p>"Going to &mdash;&mdash; pub?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Going to see that no one does go near
it," was the answer. "Picket duty for the rest of the day, we are."</p>

<p>"But Wankin&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>The young man explained, and shortly
afterwards Wankin went to headquarters
under an armed escort. Three days later
I saw his head sticking out through the
guard-room window, and at that time I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg 70]</span>
had not heard of the London road escapade.</p>

<p>"Here on account of drink?" I asked him.</p>

<p>"You fool," he roared at me. "Do you
think I mistook this damned place for the canteen?"</p>

<p>I like Wankin and most of his mates
like him. We feel that when detention,
barrack confinement and English taverns
will be things of yesterday, Wankin will
make a good and trustworthy friend in the trenches.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h2 class="sc">The Night Side of Soldiering</h2>


<p>There are three things in military life which make a great appeal to
me; the rifle's reply to the pull of
the trigger-finger, the gossip of soldiers in
the crowded canteen, and the onward movement of a thousand men in full marching
order with arms at the trail. And at no
time is this so impressive as at night when
with rifles held in a horizontal position by
the side, the arm hanging easily from the
shoulder, we march at attention in complete
silence. Not a word is spoken by anyone
save officers, little is heard but the dull
crunch of boots on the gravel and the rustle
of trenching-tool handles as they rub against
trousers or haversack. Seen from a flank
at the rear, the moving battalion, bending
round the curve or straining to a hill, looks
like the plesiosaur of the picture shown
in the act of dragging its cumbrous length
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg 72]</span>
along. The silence is full of mystery, the
gigantic mass, of which you form so minute
a unit, is entirely voiceless, a dumb thing
without a tongue, brooding, as it were, over
some eternal sorrow or ancient wrong to
which it cannot give expression. Marching
thus at night, a battalion is doubly
impressive. The silent monster is full of
restrained power; resolute in its onward
sweep, impervious to danger, it looks a
menacing engine of destruction, steady to
its goal, and certain of its mission.</p>

<p>A march like this fell to our lot once
every fortnight. At seven in the evening,
loaded with full pack, bayonet, haversack,
ground-sheet, water-bottle, overcoat, and
rifle, we would take our way from the town
out into the open country. The night
varied in temper&mdash;sometimes it rained;
again, it froze and chilled the ears and
finger-tips; and once we marched with
the full moon over us, lighting up the whole
county&mdash;the fields, the woods, the lighted
villages, the snug farmhouses, and the grey
roads by which the long line of khaki-clad
soldiers went on their way. That night was one to be remembered.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg 73]</span>

<p>We went off from the parade ground, a
thousand strong, along the sloping road
that sweeps down the hill on which our
town is built. Giggling girls watched us
depart&mdash;they are ever there when the soldiers are on the move&mdash;old gentlemen and
ladies wished us luck as we passed, but
never a head of a thousand heads turned
to the left or right, never a tongue replied
to the cheery greetings; we were marching
at attention, with arms at the trail.</p>

<p>The sky stood high, splashed with stars,
and the moon, pinched and anæmic, hung
above like a whitish speck of smoke that
had curled into a ball. Marching at the
rear, I could see the long brown line curving
round a corner ahead, the butt-plates of
the rifles sparkling brightly, the white trenching-tool
handles shaking backward and forward at every move of the men.</p>

<p>"March easy!"</p>

<p>Half an hour had passed, and we were
now in the open country. At the word
of command rifles were slung over the shoulders,
and the battalion found voice, first
in brisk conversation and exchange of witticisms, then in shouting and song. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg 74]</span>
have escaped from the tyranny of "Tipperary," none of us sing it now, but that
doggerel is replaced by other music-hall
abominations which are at present in the
full glory of their rocket-reign. A parody
of a hymn, "Toiling on," is also popular, and
my Jersey mate gave it full vent on the left.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"Lager beer! lager beer!</p>
<p>There's a lager beer saloon across the way.</p>
<p>Lager bee-ee-eer!</p>
<p>Is there any lager beer to give away."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>Although the goddess of music forgot
me in the making, I found myself roaring
out the chorus for all I was worth along with my Jersey friend.</p>

<p>"You're singing some!" he remarked,
sarcastically, when the chorus came to an
end. "But, no wonder! This night would
make a brass monkey sing. It's grand to be alive!"</p>

<p>Every battalion has its marching songs.
One of the favourites with us was written
by a certain rifleman in "C" Company,
sung to the air of "Off to Philadelphia in the Morning." It runs:</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg 75]</span>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"It is said by our commanders that in trenches out by Flanders</p>
<p>There is work to do both trying and exciting,</p>
<p>And the men who man the trenches, they are England's men and French's</p>
<p>Where the legions of the khaki-clad are fighting.</p>
<p>Though bearing up so gaily they are waiting for us daily,</p>
<p>For the fury of the foemen makes them nervous,</p>
<p>But the foe may look for trouble when we charge them at the double,</p>
<p>We, the London Irish out on active service.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<center><i>Chorus.</i></center>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

<p>Our colonel sang this song at a concert,
thus showing the democratic nature of the
New Army, where a colonel sings the songs
written in the ranks of his own battalion.</p>

<p>At the ten minutes' halt which succeeded
the first hour's march, my Jersey friend spoke
to me again. "Aren't there stars!" he said,
turning his face to the heavens and gripping
his rifle tightly as if for support. His wide
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg 77]</span>
open eyes seemed to have grown in size,
and were full of an expression I had never
seen in them before. "I like the stars,"
he remarked, "they're so wonderful. And
to think that men are killing each other
now, this very minute!" He clanked the
butt of his gun on the ground and toyed with the handle of his sword.</p>

<p>Hour after hour passed by; under the
light of the moon the country looked beautiful;
every pond showed a brilliant face
to the heavens, light mists seemed to hover
over every farmhouse and cottage; light
winds swept through the telegraph wires;
only the woods looked dark, and there the
trees seemed to be hugging the darkness around them.</p>

<p>On our way back a sharp shower, charged
with a penetrating cold, fell. The waterproof
ground-sheets were unrolled, and we
tied them over our shoulders. When the
rain passed, the water falling in drops from
our equipment glittered so brightly that
it put the polished swords and brilliant rifle butt-plates to shame.</p>

<p>We stole into the town at midnight,
when nearly all the inhabitants were abed.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg 78]</span>
With arms at the trail, we marched along,
throwing off company after company, at
the streets where they billeted. The battalion dwindled down slowly; my party
came to a halt, and the order "Dismiss!"
was given, and we went to our billets. The
Jersey youth came with me to my doorstep.</p>

<p>"'Twas a grand march!" he remarked.</p>

<p>"Fine," I replied.</p>

<p>"I can't help looking at the stars!"
he said as he moved off. "There are a lot
to-night. And to think&mdash;" He hesitated, with the words trembling on his
tongue, realising that he was going to repeat
himself. "Anyway, there's some stars,"
he said in a low voice. "Good night!"</p>

<p>There is a peculiar glamour about all
night work. The importance of night
man&oelig;uvring was emphasised in the South
African War, and we had ample opportunities of becoming accustomed to the
darkness. On one occasion at about nine
o'clock we swung out from the town with
our regimental pipe-band playing to pursue
some night operations. So far the men
did not know what task had been assigned to them.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg 79]</span>

<p>"We've got to do to-night's work as
quiet as a growing mushroom," someone
whispered to me, as we took our way off
the road and lined up in the field that,
stretching out in front and flanks, lost itself
in formless mistiness under the loom of the
encircling hedgerows. Here and there in
the distance trees stand up gaunt and bare,
holding out their leafless branches as if
in supplication to the grey sky; a slight
whisper of wind moaned along the ground and died away in the darkness.</p>

<p>Our officer, speaking in a low voice, gave
instructions. "The enemy is advancing to
attack us in great force," he explained, "and
our scouts have located him some six miles
away from here. We have now found that
it is inadvisable to march on any farther, as
our reinforcements are not very strong and
have been delayed to rear. Therefore we
have decided to take up our present position
as a suitable ground for operations and
entrenching ourselves in&mdash;ready to give battle.
Everything now must be done very quickly.
Our lives will, perhaps, depend at some
early date on the quickness with which we
can hide ourselves from the foe. So; dig
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>[pg 80]</span>
your trench as quickly as possible, as quickly,
in fact, as if your life depended on it. Work
must be done in absolute silence; no smoking
is allowed, no lighting of matches, no talk.</p>

<p>"A word about orders. Commands are
not to be shouted, but will be passed along
from man to man, and none must speak
above his breath. The passing of messages
along in this manner is very difficult; words
get lost, and unnecessary words are added
in transit. But I hope you'll make a success
of the job. Now we'll see how quickly we can get hidden!"</p>

<p>A "screen" of scouts (one man to every
fifty yards of frontage) took up its place in
line a furlong ahead. A hundred paces to
rear of the "screen" the officers marked out
the position of the trenches, placing soldiers
as markers on the imaginary alignment.
In front lay a clear field of fire, a deadly area
for an enemy advancing to the attack.</p>

<p>We took off our equipment, hafted the
entrenching tools which we always carry,
and bent to our work in the wet clay. The
night was close and foggy, the smell of the
damp earth and the awakening spring verdure
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg 81]</span>
filled our nostrils. In the distance was heard
the rumbling of trains, the jolting of wagons
along the country road, the barking of dogs,
and clear and musical through all these
sounds came the song of a mavis or merle from the near hedgerows.</p>

<p>In the course of ten minutes we were
sweating at our work, and several units of
the party took off their tunics. One hapless
individual got into trouble immediately. His
shirt was not regulation colour, it was spotlessly
white and visible at a hundred yards.
A whispered order from the officer on the
left faltered along the line of diggers.</p>

<p>"Man with white shirt, put on his tunic!"</p>

<p>The order was obeyed in haste, the white
disappeared rapidly as the arms of the culprit
slid into sleeves, and the covering tunic hid his wrong from the eyes of man.</p>

<p>The night wore on. Now and again a clock
in the town struck out the time with a dull,
weary clang that died away in the darkness.
On both sides I could see stretching out,
like some gigantic and knotted rope, the row
of bent workers, the voiceless toilers, busy
with their labours. Picks rose into the air,
remained poised a moment, then sank to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg 82]</span>
tear the sluggish earth and pull it apart.
The clay was thrown out to front and rear,
and scattered evenly, so that the natural
contour of the ground might show no signs
of man's interference. And even as we
worked the section commanders stole up and
down behind us, urging the men to make
as little sound as possible&mdash;our safety depended
on our silence. But pick and shovel,
like the rifle, will sing at their toil, and
insistent and continuous, as if in threat,
they rasped out the almost incoherent song of labour.</p>

<p>A man beside me suddenly laid down
his shovel and battled with a cough that
strove to break free and riot in the darkness.
I could see his face go purple, his eyes stare
out as if endeavouring to burst from their
sockets. Presently he was victor, and as
he bent to his shovel again I heard him
whisper huskily, "'Twas a stiff go, that; it almost floored me."</p>

<p>Thrown from tongue to tongue as a ball
is thrown in play, a message from the captain
on the flank hurried along the living line.
"Close in on the left," was the order, and
we hastened to obey. Trenching tools were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>
unhafted and returned to their carriers,
equipments were donned again, belts tightened,
and shoulder-straps buttoned. Singly,
in pairs, and in files we hurried back to the
point of assembly, to find a very angry captain awaiting us.</p>

<p>"I am very disappointed with to-night's
work," he said. "I sent five messages out;
two of them died on the way; a third reached
its destination, but in such a muddled condition
that it was impossible to recognise
it as the one sent off. The order to cease
work was the only one that seemed to hurry
along. Out at the front, where all orders
are passed along the trenches in this manner,
it is of the utmost importance that every
word is repeated distinctly, and that no
order miscarries. Even out there, it is found
very difficult to send messages along."</p>

<p>The captain paused for a moment; then
told a story. "It is said that an officer at
the front gave out the following message
to the men in the trenches: 'In the wood
on the right a party of German cavalry,'
and when the message travelled half a mile
it had changed to: 'German Navy defeated
in the North Sea.' We don't know how
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>
much truth there is in the story, but I hope
we will not make a mistake like that out there."</p>

<p>Lagging men were still stealing in as we
took up our places in columns of fours. A
clock struck out the hour of twelve, and the
bird in the hedgerow was still singing as we
marched out to the roadway, and followed our merry pipers home to town.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg 85]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h2 class="sc">Divisional Exercise and Mimic Warfare</h2>


<p>Divisional exercise is a great game of
make-believe. All sorts of liberties
are taken, the clock is put forward
or back at the command of the general, a
great enemy army is created in the twinkling
of an eye, day is turned into night and a
regular game of topsy-turvydom indulged
in. On the occasion of which I write the
whole division was out. The time was nine
o'clock in the forenoon, and an imaginary
forced march was nearly completed, and an
imaginary day was at an end. We were
being hurried up as reinforcements to the
main army, which was in touch with the
enemy ahead and an engagement was developing. Our battalion came to a halt
on the roadway, closing in to the left in order
to give full play to the field telephone service in process of being laid.</p>

<p>Our officers went out in front to seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg 86]</span>
a position for a bivouac; the doctor accompanied
them to examine the place chosen,
see to the water supply, the drainage, and
sanitation. In addition to this, our commanders
had to find the battalion a resting-ground easy to defend and of merit as a
tactical position.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock we lay down, battalion after
battalion, just as we halted: equipment
on, our packs unloosened but shoved up
under our heads, and our rifles by our sides,
muzzles towards the enemy. One word of
command would bring twenty thousand men
from their beds, ready in an instant, rifles
loaded, bayonets at hips, quick to the route
and ready for battle. We would rise, as we
slept, in full marching order, and the space
of a moment would find us hurrying, fully
armed, into battle, with the sleep of night still heavy in our eyes.</p>

<p>For miles around the soldiers lay down, each
in his place and every place occupied. Hardly a word was spoken; commands
were whispered, and our officers crept round
explaining the work ahead. Two miles in
front the enemy was assembled in great
strength on a river, and by dawn, if all went
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg 87]</span>
well, we would enter the firing line. At
present we had to lie still; no man was to
move about, and sentries with fixed bayonets
were stationed at front, flank, and rear,
ready to give the alarm at the first sign of danger.</p>

<p>Behind us were the kitchen, horse-lines,
and latrines. The position of these varies
as the wind changes, and it is imperative
that unhealthy odours are not blown across
the bivouac. The battalion lay in two
parallel squares, with a gangway, blocked
up with baggage and various necessaries,
between. On these squares no refuse was
to be thrown down; the ground had to be
kept clean; papers, scraps of meat, and
pieces of bread, if not eaten, had to be buried.</p>

<p>Even as we lay, and while the officers
were explaining the work in hand, the
artillery took up its stand on several wooded
knolls that rose behind us. What a splendid
sight, the artillery going into action! Heavy
guns, an endless line of them, swept over
the greensward and rattled into place. Six
horses strained at each gun, which was
accompanied by two ammunition wagons
with six horses to each wagon. How many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg 88]</span>
horses! How many guns! Out of nowhere
in particular they came, and disappeared
as if behind a curtain barely four hundred
yards away. Thirty minutes afterwards I
fancied as I looked in their direction that
I could see black, ominous muzzles peering
through the undergrowth. Probably I was
mistaken. Anyhow, they were there, guarding
us while we slept, our silent watchers!</p>

<p>About eleven o'clock an orderly stole in
and spoke to the colonel, a hurried consultation
in which all the officers took part was
held, and the messenger departed. Again
followed an interval of silence, only broken
by the officers creeping round and giving
us further information. The enemy was
repulsed, they told us, and was now in retreat,
but before moving off he had blown up all
the bridges on the river. The artillery of
our main army in front was shelling the
fleeing foe, and our engineers had just set
off to build three pontoon bridges, so that the
now sleeping division could cross at dawn and follow the army in retreat.</p>

<p>Our dawn came at one o'clock in the
afternoon; a whistle was blown somewhere
near at hand, and the battalion sprang to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg 89]</span>
life; every unit, with pack on back, cartridge
pouches full, rifle at the order, was
afoot and ready. Only two hours before
had the engineers set out to build the bridges
which the whole division, with its regiment
after regiment, with its artillery, its guns,
ammunition wagons and horses, its transport
section, and vehicles of all descriptions, was
now to cross. The landscape had changed
utterly, the country was alive, and had
found voice; the horse-lines were broken,
and all the animals, from the colonel's charger
to the humble pack horse, were on the move.
The little squares, dotted brown, had taken
on new shape, and were transformed into
companies of moving men in khaki. We
were out on the heels of the retreating foe.</p>

<p>Two hours' forced marching brought us
to the river, a real one, with three pontoon
bridges, newly built and held firm on flat-bottomed
boats moored in mid-stream. We
took our way across, and bent to the hill
on the other side. Half-way up, in a narrow
lane, a wagon got stuck in the front of our
battalion, and we were forced to come to
a halt for a moment. Looking back, I could
see immediately behind three lines of men
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg 90]</span>
straining to the hill; farther back the same
lines were crossing the bridges and, away
in the far distance, pencilled brown on the
ploughed fields, the three lines of khaki
crawled along like long threads endlessly
unwinding from some invisible ball. Now
and again I could see the artillery coming into
sight, only to disappear again over a wooded
knoll or into an almost invisible hollow.</p>

<p>Thus the division, the apparently limitless
lines of men, horses, and guns crawled
on the track of the fleeing enemy. As we
stood there, held in check by the wagon, and
as I looked back at the thousands of soldiers
in the rear, I felt indeed that I was a minute
mite amongst the many. And then a second
thought struck me. The whole mass of
men around me was a small thing in relation
to the numbers engaged in the great war.
Even I, Rifleman Something or Another, No.
So-and-so, bulked larger in the division as
one of its units than the division did in the
war as a unit of the Allied Forces.</p>

<p>Even more interesting than divisional
exercises is the mimic warfare that is heralded
by a notice in battalion orders such as the
following: "The battalion will take part
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg 91]</span>
in brigade exercise to-day. Ten rounds of
blank ammunition and haversack rations will be carried."</p>

<p>At eight o'clock in the morning whistles
were blown at the bottom of the street in
which my company is billeted, and the
soldiers, rubbing the sleep from their eyes
or munching the last mouthful of a hasty
breakfast, came trooping out from the snug
middle-class houses in which they are quartered.
The morning was bitterly cold, and
the falling rain splashed soberly on the
pavement, every drop coming slowly to
ground as if selecting a spot to rest on. The
colour-sergeant, standing at the end of the
street, whistle in hand, was in a nasty temper.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, you heavy-footed beggars,"
he yelled to the men. "The parade takes
place to-day, not to-morrow! And you,
what's wrong with your understandings?"
he called to a man who came along wearing carpet slippers.</p>

<p>"My boots are bad, colour," is the answer. "I cannot march in them."</p>

<p>"And are you goin' to march in them
drorin'-room abominations?" roared the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg 92]</span>
sergeant. "Get your boots mended and grease out of it."</p>

<p>At roll-call three of the company were
found to be absent; two were sick, and one
who had been found guilty of using bad
language to a N.C.O. was confined to the
guard-room. Those who answered their
names were served out with packets of blank
ammunition, one packet per man, and each
containing ten cartridges wrapped in brown paper and tied with a blue string.</p>

<p>The captain read the following instructions: "The enemy is reported to be in
strong force on X hill, and Battalions A and
B are ordered to dislodge him from that
position. A will form first line of attack,
B will send up reserves and supports as
needed." The rifles were examined by our
young lieutenant, after which inspection the
company joined the battalion, and presently
a thousand men with rifles on shoulder,
bayonets and haversacks on left hip, and
ammunition in pouches, were marching
through the rain along the muddy streets, out into the open country.</p>

<p>The day promised to be an interesting one
from my point of view; I had never taken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg 93]</span>
part in a mimic battle before, and the day's
work was to be in many ways similar to
operations on the real field of battle. "Only
nobody gets killed, of course," my mate told
me. He had taken part in this kind of work
before, and was wise in his superior knowledge.</p>

<p>"One-half of the brigade, two thousand
men, is our enemy," he explained; "and
we're going to fight them. The battalion
that's helping us is on in front, and it will
soon be fighting. When it's hard pressed
we'll go up to help, for we're the supports.
It won't be long till we hear the firing."</p>

<p>An hour's brisk march was followed by a
halt, when we were ordered to draw well into
the left of the road to let the company guns go
by. Dark-nosed and cold, they wheeled
past, the horses sweating as they strained at
the carriage shafts; the drivers, by deft
handling, pulling the steeds clear of the ruts;
out in front they swung, and the battalion
closed up and resumed its march behind.</p>

<p>The rain ceased and a cold sun shot feeble
rays over the sullen December landscape.
Again a halt was called; the brigadier-general,
followed by two officers and several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg 94]</span>
orderlies, galloped up, and a hurried consultation
with our colonel took place. In a
moment the battalion moved ahead only to
come to a dead stop again after ten minutes'
slow marching, and find a company detailed
off to guard the rear. The other companies,
led by their officers, turned off the road and
moved in sections across the newly furrowed
and soggy fields. A level sweep of December
England broken only by leafless hedgerows
and wire fencing stretched out in front towards
a wooded hillock, that stood up black against
the sky-line two miles away. The enemy
held this wood; we could hear his guns
booming and now considered ourselves under
shell fire. Each squad of sixteen men marched
in the rear or on the flank of its neighbour;
this method of progression minimises the
dangers of bursting shrapnel, for a shell
falling in the midst of one body of men and
causing considerable damage will do no harm to the adjacent party.</p>

<p>Somewhere near us our gunners were
answering the enemy's fire; but so well
hidden were the guns that I could not locate
them. We still crept slowly forward; section
after section crawled across the black, ploughed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg 95]</span>
fields, now rising up like giant caterpillars
to the crest of a mound, and again dropping
out of sight in the hollow land like corks on
a comber. On our heels the ambulance
corps followed with its stretchers, and in front
the enemy was firing vigorously; over the
belt of trees that lined the summit of the hillock
little wisps of smoke could be seen rising and fading in the air.</p>

<p>Suddenly we came into line with our guns
hidden in a deep narrow cart-track, their
dark muzzles trained on the enemy, and the
gunners, knee-deep in the mire of the lane,
sweating at their work. "We're under covering
fire now," our young lieutenant explained,
as we trudged forward, lifting enormous
masses of clay on our boots at every step.
"One battalion is engaged already; hear the shots."</p>

<p>The rifles were barking on the left front;
in a moment the reports from that quarter
died away, and the right found voice. The
men of the first line were in the trenches dug
by us a fortnight earlier, and there they
would remain, we knew, until their supports
came to their aid. Already we passed
several of them, who were detailed off on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg 96]</span>
anticipated casualty list in the morning. These
wore white labels in their buttonholes, telling
of the nature of their wounds. One label bore
the words: "Shot in right shoulder; wound
not dangerous." Another read: "Leg blown
off," and a third ran: "Flesh wounds in
arm and leg." These men would be taken
into the care of the ambulance party when it arrived.</p>

<p>When within fifteen hundred yards of the
enemy, the command for extended order
advance was given, and the section spread
out in one long line, fronting the knoll, with
five pace intervals between the men. We
were now under rifle-fire, and all further
movements forward were made in short sharp
rushes, punctuated by halts, during which we
lay flat on the ground, our bodies deep in the
soft earth, and the rain, which again commenced to fall, wetting us to the skin.</p>

<p>Six hundred yards from the enemy's front
we tumbled into the trenches already in
possession of Battalion B, and I found myself
ankle-deep in mire, beside a unit of another
regiment who was enjoying a cigarette and
blowing rings of smoke into the air. Although
no enemy was visible we got the order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg 97]</span>
to fire, and I discharged three rounds in rapid succession.</p>

<p>"Don't fire, you fool!" said the man who
was blowing the smoke rings. "Them blanks
dirty 'orrible, and when you've clean't the
clay from your clothes t'night you'll not
want to muck about with your rifle. There's
a price for copper, and I always sell my cartridge
cases. The first time I came out I fired, but never since."</p>

<p>Several rushes forward followed, and the
penultimate hundred yards were covered with
fixed bayonets. In this manner we were
prepared for any surprise. The enemy replied
fitfully to our fire, and we could now
see several khaki-clad figures with white
hat-bands&mdash;the differential symbols&mdash;moving
backwards and forwards amidst the trees.
Presently they disappeared as we worked
nearer to their lines. We were now rushing
forward, lying down to fire, rising and running
only to drop down again and discharge
another round. Within fifty yards of the
coppice the order to charge was given. A
yell, almost fiendish in its intensity, issued
from a thousand throats; anticipation of
the real work which is to be done some day,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>[pg 98]</span>
lent spirit to our rush. In an instant we
were in the wood, smashing the branches
with our bayonets, thrusting at imaginary
enemies, roaring at the top of our voices, and
capping a novel fight with a triumphant final.</p>

<p>And our enemies? Having finished their
day's work they were now fifteen minutes'
march ahead of us on the way back to their rest and rations.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg 99]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h2 class="sc">The General Inspection and the Everlasting Waiting</h2>


<p>One of our greatest trials is the general
inspection, which takes place every
month, and once Lord Kitchener inspected the battalion, in company with the
division quartered in our town. But that
was before I joined. It involves much
labour in the way of preparation. On one
occasion, midnight the night before, a Friday,
found us still busy with our work. My
cot-mate was in difficulties with his rifle&mdash;the
cloth of the pull-through stuck in the
barrel, and he could not move it, although
he broke a bamboo cane and bent a poker
in the attempt. "It's a case for the armoury," he remarked gloomily. "What a
nuisance that ramrods are done away with!
We've been at it since eight o'clock, and
getting along A1. Now that beastly pull-through!"</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg 100]</span>

<p>What an evening's work! On the day
following the brigadier-general was to inspect
us, and we had to appear on parade
spick and span, with rifles spotless, and
every article of our equipment in good
order. Packs were washed and hung over
the rim of the table by our billet fire, web-belts
were cleaned, and every speck of mud
and grease removed. Our packs, when dry,
were loaded with overcoat, mess-tin, housewife,
razor, towel, etc., and packed tightly
and squarely, showing no crease at side
or bulge at corner. Ground-sheets were
neatly rolled and fastened on top of pack,
no overlapping was allowed; rifles were
oiled and polished from muzzle to butt-plate, and swords rubbed with emery paper
until not a single speck of rust remained.</p>

<p>Saturday morning found us trim and
tidy on the parade ground. An outsider
would hardly dream that we were the men who had ploughed through the muddy
countryside and sunk to the knees in the
furrowed fields daily since the wet week
began. Where was the clay that had caked
brown on our khaki, the rust that spoilt
the lustre of our swords, and the fringes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg 101]</span>
that the wire fences tore on our tunics?
All gone; soap and water, a brush, needle
and thread, and a scrap of emery paper
had worked the miracle. We stood easy
awaiting the arrival of the general; platoons
sized from flanks to centres (namely, the
tallest men stood at the flanks, and the
khaki lines dwindled in stature towards
the small men in the middle), and company
officers at front and rear. The officers saw
that everything was correct, that no lace-ends
showed from under the puttees, that
no lace-eye lay idle, and that laces were not
crossed over the boots. Each man had
shaved and got his hair cut, his hat set
straight on his head, and the regimental
badge in proper position over the idle chin-strap.
Pocket-flaps and tunics were buttoned, water-bottles and haversacks hung
straight, the tops of the latter in line with
the bayonet rings, and entrenching tool
handles were scrubbed clean&mdash;my mate and I
had spent much soap on ours the night before.</p>

<p>One of our officers gave us instructions
as to how we had to behave during the
inspection, more especially when we were
under the direct gaze of the general.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg 102]</span>

<p>"Not a movement," he told us. "Every
eyelash must be still. If the general asks
me your name and I make a mistake and
say you are Smith instead of Brown, your
real name, you're not to say a word. You
are Brown for the time being. If he speaks
to you, you're to answer: 'Sir,' and 'Sir'
only to every question. If you're asked
what was your age last birthday, 'Sir'
is to be the only answer. Is that clear to every man?"</p>

<p>It was, indeed, clear, surprisingly clear;
but we wondered at the command, which
was new to us. To answer in this fashion
appeared strange to us; we thought (the
right to think is not denied to a soldier)
it a funny method of satisfying a general's curiosity.</p>

<p>He came, a tall, well-set man, with stern
eyebrows and a heavy moustache, curled
upwards after the manner of an Emperor
whom we heartily dislike, attended by a
slim brigade major, who wore a rather large
eyeglass, and made several entries in his
notebook, as he followed on the heels of
the superior inspecting the battalion.</p>

<p>We stood, every unit of us, sphinx-like,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg 103]</span>
immovable, facing our front and resigned
to our position. To an onlooker it might
seem as if we were frozen there&mdash;our fingers
glued on to our rifles and our feet firm to
the earth at an angle of forty-five degrees.
I stood near the rear, and could see the
still platoons in front, not a hat moved, not
a boot shifted. The general broke the spell when he was passing me.</p>

<p>"Another button. There were forty-seven
the last time," he said, and the man with
the eyeglass made an entry in the notebook. Through an oversight, I had helped
to lower the prestige of the battalion: a
pocket flap of my tunic was unbuttoned.</p>

<p>Kit inspection was a business apart;
the general picked out several soldiers haphazard
and ordered their packs to be opened
for an examination of the contents&mdash;spoons,
shirts, socks, and the various necessaries
which dismounted men in full marching order
must carry on their persons were inspected
carefully. A full pack is judged best by
its contents, and nearly all packs passed
muster. One man was unlucky: his mate
was chosen for kit inspection, but this hapless
individual came out minus a toothbrush
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg 104]</span>
and comb, and the friend in need took his
place in the freshly-formed ranks. Here,
the helper found that his own kit was inefficient,
he had forgotten to put in a pair of
socks. That afternoon he had to do two hours' extra drill.</p>

<p>Perhaps an even greater trial than Divisional
Inspection was that of waiting orders
when we were the victims of camp rumours.
But this was as nothing to the false alarms.
There is some doggerel known to the men which runs:</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"We're off to the front," said the colonel,</p>
<p class="i4">as he placed us in the train,</p>
<p>"And we went at dawn from the station,</p>
<p class="i4">and at night came back again."</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>For months we had drilled and drilled,
all earnest in our labours and filled with
enthusiasm for our new profession, and daily
we await the order to leave for foreign
parts. Where are we going to when we
leave England? France, Egypt, or India?
Rumour had it yesterday that we would
go to Egypt; to-day my mate, the blue-eyed Jersey youth, heard from a friend,
who heard it from a colour-sergeant, that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg 105]</span>
we are going out to India, where we will
be kept as guardians of the King's Empire
for a matter of four years. Ever since I
joined the Army it has been the same:
reports name a new destination for my battalion daily.</p>

<p>Afterwards we had to go and help the
remarkable Russians who passed through
England on the way to France; but when
the Russians faded from the ken of vision
and the Press Bureau denied their very
existence, it was immediately reported that
we had been drilled into shape in order to
demolish De Wet and all his South African
rebels. De Wet was captured and is now
under military control, and still we waited
orders to move from the comfortable billets
and crowded streets of our town. Dry eyes
would see us depart, mocking children would
bid us sarcastic farewells, the kindly landladies
and their fair daughters would laugh
when we bade adieu and moved away to
some destination unknown. We had already
taken our farewell three times, and
on each occasion we have come back again
to our billets before the day that saw our departure came to an end.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg 106]</span>

<p>The heart of every man thrilled with
excitement when the announcement was
made for the first time, one weary evening
when we had just completed a ten-hour
divisional field exercise. Our officer read it
from a typewritten sheet, and the announcement was as follows:</p>

<blockquote><p>
"All men in the battalion must stand
under arms until further orders. No
soldier is to leave his billet; boots are
not to be taken off, and best marching
pairs are to be worn. Every unit of
the company who lacks any part of
the necessary equipment must immediately
report at quartermaster's stores,
where all wants will be supplied. Identity
discs to be worn, swords must be
cleaned and polished, and twenty-four
hours' haversack rations are to be carried.
The battalion has to entrain for
some unknown destination when called
upon."
</p></blockquote>

<p>The news spread through the town: the
division was going to move! On the morrow
we would be sailing for France, in a
fortnight we would be in Berlin! Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg 107]</span>
landladies met us at the doors as we came
in, looks of entreaty on their faces and tears
in their eyes. The hour had come; we
were going to leave them. And the landladies' daughters? One, a buxom wench
of eighteen, kissed the Jersey youth in sight
of the whole battalion, but nobody took
any notice of the unusual incident. All
were busy with their own thoughts, and
eager for the new adventures before them.</p>

<p>I did not go to sleep that night; booted
and dressed I lay on the hearthrug in front
of the fire, and waited for the call. About
four o'clock in the morning a whistle was
blown outside on the street; I got to my
feet, put on my equipment, fastened the
buckles of my haversack, bade adieu to
my friends of the billet who had risen from
bed to see me off, and joined my company.</p>

<p>Five or six regiments were already on
the move; transport wagons, driven by
khaki-clad drivers with rifles slung over
their shoulders, lumbered through the dimly-lighted
thoroughfares; ammunition vans
stood at every street corner; guns rattled
along drawn by straining horses, the sweat
steaming from the animals' flanks and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg 108]</span>
withers; an ambulance party sped through
the greyness of the foggy morning, accompanied by a Red Cross lorry piled high
with chests and stretcher poles, and soldiers
in files and fours, in companies and columns,
were in movement everywhere&mdash;their legions seemed countless and endless.</p>

<p>Ammunition was given out from the
powder magazine; each man was handed
150 rounds of ball cartridge&mdash;a goodly weight
to carry on a long day's march! With our
ammunition we were now properly equipped
and ready for any emergency. Each individual carried on his person in addition
to rifle, bayonet (sword is the military
name for the latter weapon) and ball cartridge,
a blanket and waterproof sheet, an
overcoat, a water-bottle, an entrenching
tool and handle, as well as several other
lighter necessaries, such as shirts, socks, a
knife, fork, and spoon, razor, soap, and towel.</p>

<p>At eight o'clock, when the wintry dawn
was breaking and the fog lifting, we entered
the station. Hundreds of the inhabitants
of the town came to see us off and cheer
us on the long way to Tipperary: and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg 109]</span>
Tipperary meant Berlin. One of the inhabitants, a kindly woman who is loved by
the soldiers of my company, to whom she
is very good, came to the station as we were
leaving, and presented a pair of mittens to each of fifty men.</p>

<p>The train started on its journey, puffed
a feeble cloud of smoke into the air, and
suddenly came to a dead stop. Heads
appeared at the windows, and voices inquired if the engine-driver had taken the
wrong turning on the road to Berlin. The
train shunted back into the station, and
we all went back to our billets again, but
not before our officers informed us that we
had done the work of entraining very smartly,
and when the real call did come we would
lose no time on the journey to an unknown destination.</p>

<p>Later we had two further lessons in entraining, and we came to fear that when
the summons did come dry eyes would
watch us depart and sarcastic jibes make
heavy our leave-taking. Indeed, some of
the inhabitants of our town hinted that
we should never leave the place until the
local undertakers make a profit on our exit.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg 110]</span>
So much for their gentle sarcasm! But
well they knew that one day in the near
future it would suddenly occur to our commanders
to take us with them in the train to Berlin.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg 111]</span>




<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h2 class="sc">Ready to Go&mdash;The Battalion Moves</h2>


<p>Rumour had been busy for days; the whole division was about to move,
so every one stated, except our
officers, and official information was not forthcoming.</p>

<p>"You are going between midnight and
five o'clock to-morrow morning," announced
my landlord positively. He is a coal-merchant by trade.</p>

<p>"How do you know?" I inquired.</p>

<p>"Because I can't get any coal to-morrow&mdash;line's bunged up for the troops."</p>

<p>"No, he'll be going on Tuesday," said
his wife, whose kindliness and splendid cooking I should miss greatly.</p>

<p>"Is that so?" I asked, feigning an interest which I did not feel. A sore toe
eclipsed all other matters for the time being.</p>

<p>"The ration men have served out enough
for two days, and it doesn't stand to reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg 112]</span>
that they're going to waste anything," the
little lady continued with sarcastic emphasis on the last two words.</p>

<p>Parades went on as usual; the usual
rations were doled out to billets and the
usual grumbling went on in the ranks. We
were weary of false alarms, waiting orders,
and eternal parades. Some of us had been
training for fully six months, others had
joined the Army when war broke out, and
we were still secure in England. "Why
have we joined?" the men asked. "Is
it to line the streets when the troops come home? We are a balmy regiment."</p>

<p>One evening, Thursday to be exact, the
battalion orders were interesting. One item
ran as follows: "All fees due to billets
will be paid up to Friday night. If any other
billet expenses are incurred by battalion
the same will be paid on application to the
War Office." Friday evening found more
explicit expression of our future movements
in orders. The following items appeared:
"Mess tin covers will be issued to-morrow.
No white handkerchiefs are to be taken by
the battalion overseas. All deficiencies in
kit must be reported to-morrow morning.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg 113]</span>
Bayonets will be sharpened. Any soldiers
who have not yet received a copy of the
New Testament can have same on application
at the Town Hall 6 p.m. on Saturday.</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" we asked one
another. Some answered saying that we
were to help in the sack of Constantinople,
others suggested Egypt, but all felt that
we were going off to France at no very
distant date. Was not this feeling plausible
when we took into account a boot parade
of the day before and how we were ordered
to wear two pairs of socks when trying on
the boots? Two pairs of socks suggested
the trenches and cold, certainly not the
sun-dried gutters of Constantinople, or the burning sands of Egypt.</p>

<p>Saturday saw an excited battalion mustered
in front of the quartermaster's stores
drawing out boots, mess-tin covers, blankets,
ground-sheets, entrenching tools, identity
discs, new belts, water-bottles, pack-straps,
trousers, tunics and the hundred and one
other things required by the soldier on active
service. In addition to the usual requisites,
every unit received a cholera belt (they are
more particular over this article of attire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg 114]</span>
than over any other), two pairs of pants, a
singlet and a cake of soap. The latter
looked tallowy and nobody took it further
than the billet; the pants were woollen, very
warm and made in Canada. This reminds
me of an amusing episode which took place
last general inspection. While standing
easy, before the brigadier-general made his
appearance, the men compared razors and
found that eighty per cent. of them had
been made in Germany. But these were
bought by the soldiers before war started.
At least all affirmed that this was so.</p>

<p>Saturday was a long parade; some soldiers
were drawing necessaries at midnight, and
no ten-o'-clock-to-billets order was enforced
that night. I drew my boots at eleven
o'clock, and then the streets were crowded
with our men, and merry and sad with
sightseers and friends. Wives and sweethearts
had come to take a last farewell of
husbands and lovers, and were making the
most of the last lingering moments in good wishes and tears.</p>

<p>Sunday.&mdash;No church parade; and all men
stood under arms in the streets. The officers
had taken off all the trumpery of war, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg 115]</span>
swords which they never learned to use,
the sparkling hat-badges and the dainty
wrist-watches. They now appeared in web
equipment, similar to that worn by the men,
and carried rifles. Dressed thus an officer
will not make a special target for the sniper
and is not conspicuous by his uniform.</p>

<p>Our captain made the announcement in
a quiet voice, the announcement which had
been waited for so long. "To-morrow we
proceed overseas," he said. "On behalf of
the colonel I've to thank you all for the
way in which you have done your work up
to the present, and I am certain that when
we get out yonder," he raised his arm and
his gesture might indicate any point of the
compass, "you'll all do your work with
the spirit and determination which you have shown up till now."</p>

<p>This was the announcement. The men
received it gleefully and a hubbub of conversation
broke out in the ranks. "We're
going at last"; "I thought when I joined
that I'd be off next morning"; "What
price a free journey to Berlin!"; "It'll
be some great sport!" Such were the
remarks that were bandied to and fro. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg 116]</span>
some were silent, feeling, no doubt, that
the serious work ahead was not the subject for idle chatter.</p>

<p>A little leaflet entitled "Rules for the
Preservation of Health on Field Service,"
was given to each man, and I am at liberty to give a few quotations.</p>

<p>"Remember that disease attacks you from
outside; it is your duty to keep it outside."</p>

<p>"Don't drink unboiled water if you can get boiled water."</p>

<p>"Never start on a march with an empty stomach."</p>

<p>"Remember that a dirty foot is an unsound foot. See that feet are washed if
no other part of the body is. Socks should
be taken off at the end of the march, be
flattened out and well shaken. Put on a
clean pair if possible, if not, put the left
sock on the right foot, and vice versa."</p>

<p>"Remember, on arrival in camp, <i>food before fatigues</i>."</p>

<p>"Always rig up some kind of shelter at
night for the head, if for no other part of the body."</p>

<p>At twelve noon on Monday the whistles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg 117]</span>
blew at the bottom of the street and we all
turned out in full marching order with
packs, haversacks, rifles and swords. I heard
the transport wagons clattering on the pavement,
the merry laughter of the drivers, the
noise of men falling into place and above
all the voice of the sergeant-major issuing orders.</p>

<p>Yet this, like other days, was a "wash-out." All day we waited for orders to
move, twice we paraded in full marching
kit, eager for the command to entrain; but
it was not forthcoming. Another day had
to be spent in billets under strict instructions
not to move from our quarters. The orders
were posted up as usual at all street corners,
a plan which is adopted for the convenience
of units billeted a great distance from headquarters,
and the typewritten orders had an air of momentous finality:</p>

<p>The battalion moves to-morrow.</p>

<p>Parade will be at 4.30 a.m.</p>

<p>Entraining and detraining and embarking must be done in absolute silence.</p>

<p>I rose from bed at three and set about to
prepare breakfast, while my cot-mate busied
himself with our equipment, putting everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg 118]</span>
into shape, buckling belts and flaps,
burnishing bayonets and oiling the bolts of
the rifles. Twenty-four hours' rations were
stored away in our haversacks all ready,
the good landlady had been at work stewing and frying meat and cooking dainty
scones up to twelve o'clock the night before.</p>

<p>When breakfast, a good hearty meal of tea,
buttered toast, fried bacon and tomatoes,
was over, we went out to our places. The
morning was chilly, a cold wind splashed with
hail swept along the streets and whirled
round the corners, causing the tails of our great
coats to beat sharply against our legs. It
was still very dark, only a few street-lamps
were lighted and these glimmered doubtfully
as if ashamed of being noticed. Men in full
marching order stamped out from every
billet, took their way to the main street, where
the transport wagons, wheels against kerbstones,
horses in shafts, and drivers at reins,
stood in mathematical order, and from there
on to the parade ground where sergeants,
with book in one hand and electric torch
in the other, were preparing to call the roll.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg 119]</span>

<p>Ammunition was served out, one hundred
and twenty rounds to each man, and this
was placed in the cartridge pouches, rifles
were inspected and identity discs examined
by torch-light. This finished, we were allowed
to stand easy and use ground-sheets for a
shelter from the biting hail. Our blankets
were already gone. The transport wagons
had disappeared and with them our field-bags.
I suppose they will await us in &mdash;&mdash; but
I anticipate, and at present all we know
is that our regiment is bound for some
destination unknown where, when we arrive,
we shall have to wear two pairs of socks at our work.</p>

<p>We stood by till eight o'clock. The day
had cleared and the sun was shining brightly
when we marched off to the station, through
streets lined with people, thoughtful men
who seemed to be very sad, women who wept
and children who chattered and sang "Tipperary."</p>

<p>Three trains stood in the sidings by the
station. Places were allotted to the men,
eight occupied each compartment, non-commissioned
officers occupied a special carriage,
the officers travelled first-class.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg 120]</span>

<p>Soon we were hurrying through England
to a place unknown. Most of my comrades
were merry and a little sentimental; they
sang music-hall songs that told of home.
There were seven with me in my compartment,
the Jersey youth, whom I saw kissing
a weeping sweetheart in the cold hours of the
early day; Mervin, my cot-mate, who always
cleaned the rifles while I cooked breakfast in
the morning; Bill, the Cockney youth who
never is so happy as when getting the best
of an argument in the coffee-shop of which I
have already spoken, and the Oxford man.
The other three were almost complete strangers
to me, they have just been drafted into our
regiment; one was very fat and reminded me
of a Dickens character in <i>Pickwick Papers</i>;
another who soon fell asleep, his head warm
in a Balaclava helmet, was a tall, strapping
youth with large muscular hands, which
betoken manual labour, and the last was a
slightly-built boy with a budding moustache
which seemed to have been waxed at one
end. We noticed this, and the fat soldier
said that the wax had melted from the
few lonely hairs on the other side of the lip.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg 121]</span>

<p>Stations whirled by, Mervin leant out of
the window to read their names, but was
never successful. Cigarettes were smoked,
the carriage was full of tobacco fumes and
the floor littered with "fag-ends." Rifles
were lying on the racks, four in each side,
and caps, papers and equipment piled on
top of them. The Jersey youth made a remark:</p>

<p>"Where are we going to?" he asked. "France I suppose, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Maybe Egypt," someone answered.</p>

<p>"With two pairs of socks to one boot!"
Mervin muttered in sarcastic tones; and
almost immediately fell asleep. He had been
a great traveller and knows many countries.
His age is about forty, but he owns to twenty-seven,
and in his youth he was educated for
the church. "But the job was not one for
me," he says, "and I threw it up." He
looks forward to the life of a soldier in the field.</p>

<p>Our train journey neared the end. Bill
was at the window and said that we were
in sight of our destination. All were up
and fumbling with their equipment; and
one, the University man, hoped that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg 122]</span>
night would be a good one for sailing to France.</p>

<p>If we are bound for France we shall be there to-morrow.</p>

<h4>JUST PUBLISHED</h4>


<h2>THE RAT-PIT</h2>

<h3>By <span class="sc">Patrick MacGill</span>, Author of
"Children of the Dead End." Crown 8vo.
Price 6/-. Inland Postage 5d. extra.</h3>

<p>"Children of the Dead End" came
upon the literary world as something
of a surprise; it dealt with a phase of life about which nothing was
known. It was compared with the work of
Borrow and Kipling. Incidentally three editions,
aggregating 10,000 copies, were called for within
fifteen days. In his new book Mr. MacGill still
deals with the underworld he knows so well.
He tells of a life woven of darkest threads, full
of pity and pathos, lighted up by that rare and
quaint humour that made his first book so attractive.
"The Rat-Pit" tells the story of an Irish
peasant girl brought up in an atmosphere of
poverty, where the purity of the poor and the
innocence of maidenhood stand out in simple
relief against a grim and sombre background.
Norah Ryan leaves her home at an early age, and
is plunged into a new world where dissolute and
heedless men drag her down to their own miry
level. Mr. MacGill's lot has been cast in strange
places, and every incident of his book is pregnant
with a vivid realism that carries the conviction
that it is a literal transcript from life, as in fact
it is. Only last summer, just before he enlisted,
Mr. MacGill spent some time in Glasgow reviving
old memories of its underworld. His characters
are mostly real persons, and their sufferings, the
sufferings of women burdened and oppressed with
wrongs which women alone bear, are a strong
indictment against a dubious civilisation.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
